  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 mt-10 text-foreground">Complete Guide to Spanish Property Notary Completion</h2>
  
  <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">The notary completion (firma en notar√≠a) is the culmination of the Spanish property buying process. This formal ceremony legally transfers ownership from seller to buyer and must be conducted before a Spanish notary public who ensures all legal requirements are met.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Who Attends the Completion</h3>
  
  <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">All parties involved in the transaction must attend or be legally represented. The buyer and seller can attend in person or grant power of attorney to their lawyers. The notary oversees the entire process and ensures legal compliance.</p>

  <ul class="feature-list list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
    <li class="ml-4"><strong>The buyer:</strong> Either in person or through power of attorney</li>

  <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">The notary reads through the title deed (escritura de compraventa) in Spanish, explaining key terms and conditions. Both parties confirm their understanding and agreement before signing. The buyer then makes the final payment, usually by banker''s draft or certified transfer.</p>

  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Post-Completion Requirements</h3>

<div class="detailed-content">
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 mt-10 text-foreground">Property Deed Registration in Costa del Sol</h2>
  
  <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Property deed registration is the final administrative step that provides official legal recognition of your ownership. While the notary completion transfers ownership, registration with the Land Registry provides additional legal protection and is essential for certain future transactions.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">The Spanish Land Registry System</h3>
  
  <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">The Registro de la Propiedad is Spain''s official property ownership database. Each property has a unique registration number and detailed records of ownership history, charges, restrictions, and legal status. Registration provides legal security and priority protection for property rights.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Registration Process and Timeline</h3>
  
  <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Your lawyer submits the signed title deed to the appropriate Land Registry office along with required documentation and fees.

  <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Registration fees are calculated based on property value and are typically around 0.1-0.3% of the purchase price. These costs are usually paid by the buyer and are separate from notary fees and transfer taxes.</p>
