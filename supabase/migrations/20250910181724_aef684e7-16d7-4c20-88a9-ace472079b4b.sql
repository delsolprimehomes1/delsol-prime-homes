    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">When buying property in Costa del Sol as a foreign investor, the complexity of Spanish real estate law, tax implications, and local market dynamics can be overwhelming. Our comprehensive consultation service bridges this knowledge gap, providing you with expert guidance tailored specifically to UK and Irish buyers investing in Marbella, Estepona, and the broader Costa del Sol region.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">What Our Consultation Includes</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Our consultation process begins with a detailed financial assessment of your buying power in the Spanish market. We analyze your current financial position, including income verification requirements for Spanish mortgages, tax implications in both Spain and your home country, and the total cost of ownership including community fees, IBI taxes, and maintenance costs.</p>

  content = '<div class="short-answer mb-6 p-4 bg-muted/30 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-primary">
    <p class="text-lg font-medium text-foreground">Foreign buyers can access Spanish mortgages, typically 60–70% loan-to-value. Approval depends on income, credit history, and property valuation in the competitive Costa del Sol market.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="detailed-content">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 mt-10 text-foreground">Complete Guide to Spanish Mortgage Financing for Expats</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Securing mortgage financing as an expat in Spain involves understanding a different banking system, meeting specific residency requirements, and navigating unique lending criteria. Spanish banks have developed specialized products for foreign buyers, particularly those from the UK and Ireland investing in Costa del Sol properties. The process requires careful preparation and understanding of both Spanish and international financial requirements.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Loan-to-Value Ratios and Eligibility</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Spanish banks typically offer different loan-to-value ratios based on your residency status. Spanish residents can access up to 80% financing, while non-residents are generally limited to 60-70% LTV. However, some banks offer up to 70% for non-residents with strong financial profiles, particularly those with existing relationships with international banking networks.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
      <li class="ml-4"><strong>Spanish residents:</strong> Up to 80% LTV with competitive rates starting from 2.5%</li>
      <li class="ml-4"><strong>EU non-residents:</strong> 60-70% LTV with rates typically 0.5-1% higher than resident rates</li>
      <li class="ml-4"><strong>Non-EU residents:</strong> 60% LTV with additional documentation requirements</li>
      <li class="ml-4"><strong>Investment properties:</strong> Generally limited to 60% LTV regardless of residency status</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Required Documentation for Mortgage Applications</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Spanish mortgage applications require extensive documentation, particularly for foreign applicants. Banks need to verify your income stability, creditworthiness, and ability to service the loan. The documentation process can take 4-8 weeks, so early preparation is essential for a smooth property purchase process.</p>

    <div class="bg-muted/30 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6">
      <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-foreground">Essential Documents for Mortgage Application:</h4>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        <li class="ml-4">NIE (Número de Identificación de Extranjero)</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Passport and residence documentation</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Last 3 months payslips or proof of self-employment income</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Last 2 years tax returns from your home country</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Bank statements from your home country (6 months)</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Employment contract or business registration</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Credit report from your home country</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Property valuation report (arranged by the bank)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Income Requirements and Debt-to-Income Ratios</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Spanish banks typically require that your total monthly debt payments, including the new mortgage, do not exceed 35-40% of your net monthly income. For non-residents, this calculation includes existing commitments in your home country. Banks prefer stable employment with contracts exceeding the mortgage term and may require higher income multiples for self-employed applicants.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Interest Rates and Mortgage Terms</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Spanish mortgage rates for non-residents typically range from 3% to 4.5%, depending on the bank, your profile, and market conditions. Most banks offer both fixed and variable rate options, with terms extending up to 30 years for younger borrowers. The maximum age at mortgage completion is typically 75 years, which affects the available term length.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Currency Considerations and Exchange Risk</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Most expats earn income in their home currency while taking a Euro-denominated mortgage. This creates currency exchange risk that must be carefully considered. Some banks offer multi-currency mortgages or currency hedging products to mitigate this risk. Additionally, consider the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on your effective mortgage payments over time.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Mortgage Pre-Approval Process</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Obtaining mortgage pre-approval before property hunting provides significant advantages in the competitive Costa del Sol market. Pre-approval demonstrates serious intent to sellers and can strengthen negotiating positions. The process typically takes 2-4 weeks and provides certainty about your borrowing capacity before making property offers.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Working with Mortgage Brokers</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Specialist mortgage brokers who understand both Spanish banking and international client needs can significantly streamline the process. They have relationships with multiple banks, understand current lending criteria, and can identify the most suitable products for your specific situation. Brokers can also assist with documentation preparation and translation requirements.</p>
