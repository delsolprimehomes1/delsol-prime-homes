  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 mt-10 text-foreground">Understanding Spanish Property Reservation Contracts</h2>
  
  <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">A reservation contract (contrato de reserva or contrato de arras) is the first formal agreement in a Spanish property transaction. It secures your chosen property while allowing time to arrange financing, complete legal due diligence, and prepare for the main purchase contract.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Purpose and Benefits</h3>
  
  <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">The reservation contract provides legal security for both buyer and seller during the preliminary stages. It prevents the seller from marketing the property to other buyers while giving you confirmed time to complete essential preparations for purchase.</p>

  <ul class="feature-list list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
    <li class="ml-4"><strong>Market withdrawal:</strong> Property removed from sale during reservation period</li>
    <li class="ml-4"><strong>Price protection:</strong> Agreed purchase price cannot be changed</li>
    <li class="ml-4"><strong>Due diligence time:</strong> Period to complete legal and financial checks</li>
    <li class="ml-4"><strong>Mortgage arrangement:</strong> Time to secure financing approval</li>
    <li class="ml-4"><strong>Legal preparation:</strong> Opportunity to engage lawyers and complete searches</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Typical Terms and Conditions</h3>
  
  <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Reservation contracts typically require a deposit of 3,000-6,000 euros and provide 2-4 weeks to complete preparations. The contract specifies conditions under which either party can withdraw and the consequences of doing so.</p>

  <ul class="feature-list list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
    <li class="ml-4"><strong>Reservation deposit:</strong> Usually 3,000-6,000€ held in lawyer''s client account</li>
    <li class="ml-4"><strong>Reservation period:</strong> Typically 14-30 days for buyer preparations</li>
    <li class="ml-4"><strong>Purchase price:</strong> Total agreed amount including any extras</li>
    <li class="ml-4"><strong>Completion timeline:</strong> Expected timeframe for final purchase</li>
    <li class="ml-4"><strong>Withdrawal conditions:</strong> Circumstances allowing contract termination</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Legal Protections</h3>
  
  <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">A well-drafted reservation contract should include protective clauses that allow withdrawal without penalty under specified circumstances, such as mortgage refusal, unsatisfactory legal searches, or structural survey issues.</p>

  <ul class="feature-list list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
    <li class="ml-4"><strong>Mortgage contingency:</strong> Withdrawal allowed if financing is refused</li>
    <li class="ml-4"><strong>Legal approval:</strong> Subject to satisfactory legal due diligence</li>
    <li class="ml-4"><strong>Survey conditions:</strong> Protection against structural or title issues</li>
    <li class="ml-4"><strong>License verification:</strong> Contingent on valid building permits</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">What Happens Next</h3>
  
  <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Once signed, you have the agreed timeframe to complete mortgage applications, legal searches, and any required surveys. If all conditions are met, you proceed to sign the private purchase contract. The reservation deposit typically forms part of the main contract deposit.</p>
