      <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Community fees are monthly or annual charges paid by property owners in Spanish residential developments to cover the cost of maintaining shared facilities and common areas. These fees are mandatory for all property owners and represent a significant ongoing cost that must be factored into property ownership budgets.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">What Community Fees Cover</h3>
      <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Community fees typically cover maintenance of swimming pools, gardens, elevators, security systems, lighting, cleaning of common areas, insurance for communal facilities, and management administration costs. Premium developments may include additional services such as concierge, gym maintenance, and 24-hour security patrols.</p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Fee Calculation and Variations</h3>
      <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Fees are calculated based on property size, location within the development, and the range of facilities available. Beachfront developments with extensive amenities typically charge higher fees, while basic apartment blocks have minimal charges. Penthouses and larger properties usually pay proportionally higher fees based on their coefficient of participation.</p>
