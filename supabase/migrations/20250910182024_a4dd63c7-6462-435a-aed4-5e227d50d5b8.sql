    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 mt-10 text-foreground">Complete Tax Guide for Non-Resident Spanish Property Owners</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Owning property in Spain as a non-resident involves several tax obligations that must be understood and properly managed. Spanish tax law requires non-residents to comply with specific annual filing requirements, regardless of whether the property generates rental income. Proper tax planning and compliance protect your investment while optimizing your tax position.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">IBI Property Tax (Impuesto sobre Bienes Inmuebles)</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">IBI is the annual local property tax levied by municipalities, similar to council tax in the UK. Rates vary significantly between municipalities, ranging from 0.4% to 1.1% of the cadastral value (valor catastral) of the property. The cadastral value is typically lower than market value, making IBI relatively affordable compared to other European property taxes.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
      <li class="ml-4"><strong>Tax rate:</strong> 0.4%-1.1% of cadastral value annually</li>
      <li class="ml-4"><strong>Payment timing:</strong> Usually due in September-November</li>
      <li class="ml-4"><strong>Calculation basis:</strong> Municipal cadastral value, not market value</li>
      <li class="ml-4"><strong>Responsibility:</strong> Property owner as of January 1st each year</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Non-Resident Income Tax (IRNR)</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Non-residents must pay annual income tax on Spanish property, even if no rental income is generated. For non-rental properties, tax is calculated on a deemed rental income of 1.1% or 2% of the cadastral value, depending on when the cadastral value was last updated. This "imputed income" is taxed at 19% for EU residents and 24% for non-EU residents.</p>

    <div class="bg-muted/30 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6">
      <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-foreground">IRNR Tax Calculation Example:</h4>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        <li class="ml-4">Property cadastral value: €200,000</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Imputed rental income: €200,000 × 1.1% = €2,200</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Tax due (EU resident): €2,200 × 19% = €418 annually</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Tax due (non-EU resident): €2,200 × 24% = €528 annually</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Wealth Tax (Impuesto sobre el Patrimonio)</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Wealth tax applies to non-residents with Spanish assets exceeding €700,000. The tax is calculated on the market value of Spanish property and other assets, with rates ranging from 0.2% to 3.75% depending on the total value. Many Spanish regions have abolished or reduced wealth tax, but non-residents are subject to the general state rates.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Rental Income Tax for Investment Properties</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Properties generating rental income are subject to different tax treatment. Gross rental income is taxed at 19% for EU residents and 24% for non-EU residents, with allowable deductions including property management costs, maintenance, insurance, and depreciation. Proper record-keeping is essential for claiming legitimate deductions.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Capital Gains Tax on Property Sales</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">When selling Spanish property as a non-resident, capital gains are subject to tax at 19% for EU residents and 24% for non-EU residents. The gain is calculated as the difference between sale price and acquisition cost, adjusted for inflation and improvement costs. Additionally, a 3% retention is withheld from the gross sale proceeds and paid to Spanish tax authorities.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Tax Filing Deadlines and Procedures</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Non-resident income tax returns must be filed annually between January 1st and December 31st of the following year. Most non-residents file during the summer months to align with Spanish tax advisory availability. Late filing incurs penalties and interest charges, making timely compliance essential.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Double Taxation Treaties and Tax Planning</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Spain has double taxation treaties with most EU countries and many others worldwide, preventing double taxation on the same income. However, tax planning is still essential to optimize your overall tax position. Consider factors like Spanish tax residency rules, home country tax obligations, and the timing of property sales to minimize total tax liability.</p>

    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Property insurance in Spain is essential for protecting your investment against natural disasters, theft, liability claims, and structural damage. Understanding Spanish insurance requirements, coverage options, and cost factors helps you make informed decisions while ensuring adequate protection for your Costa del Sol property.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Mandatory vs. Optional Insurance Coverage</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">While comprehensive property insurance is not legally mandatory in Spain, mortgage lenders require building insurance as a loan condition. Additionally, community developments often mandate insurance coverage to protect shared facilities and common areas. Even without legal requirements, comprehensive insurance is strongly recommended given the financial risks of property ownership.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
      <li class="ml-4"><strong>Building structure insurance:</strong> Required by mortgage lenders</li>
      <li class="ml-4"><strong>Contents insurance:</strong> Optional but recommended</li>
      <li class="ml-4"><strong>Public liability:</strong> Essential for rental properties</li>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Types of Coverage Available</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Spanish property insurance policies typically offer several coverage levels, from basic building protection to comprehensive packages including contents, liability, and additional services. Understanding the differences helps you select appropriate coverage for your specific property type and usage patterns.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Regional Risk Factors and Specialized Coverage</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Costa del Sol properties face specific risks including flood damage from heavy rains, earthquake damage, and coastal erosion effects. Some areas are designated as high-risk flood zones requiring specialized coverage. Understanding local risk factors ensures adequate protection while avoiding unnecessary premium costs.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Insurance Costs and Factors Affecting Premiums</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Spanish property insurance costs vary significantly based on property value, location, age, construction type, and chosen coverage levels. Coastal properties typically cost more to insure due to weather exposure, while newer properties with modern security systems often qualify for discounts.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Claims Process and Documentation Requirements</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Spanish insurance claims require proper documentation and timely notification to insurers. Understanding the claims process, required evidence, and typical settlement timeframes helps ensure smooth claim resolution when incidents occur. Many policies include 24-hour emergency claim reporting services.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Choosing the Right Insurance Provider</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Select insurers with strong financial ratings, established Spanish operations, and English-language customer service for international property owners.
