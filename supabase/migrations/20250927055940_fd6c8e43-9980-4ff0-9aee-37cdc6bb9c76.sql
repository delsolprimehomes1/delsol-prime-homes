## Introduction

Purchasing property on the Costa del Sol represents a significant financial commitment, typically ranging from €500,000 to €5 million for luxury properties. This comprehensive finance checklist ensures you''ve verified every financial aspect before committing to your dream home in Marbella, Estepona, or surrounding areas.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I get a mortgage without Spanish income?
Yes, Spanish banks offer non-resident mortgages based on international income. Expect stricter requirements: 40% down payment, income verification from your home country, and possibly higher interest rates than residents pay.

### What''s the minimum down payment needed?
Non-residents typically need 40% down payment plus 12-15% for taxes and costs. For a €500,000 property, prepare €280,000-€300,000 in accessible funds before starting your search.

### How long do I have to pay property taxes?
IBI property tax is due annually between September and November. Set up direct debit through your Spanish bank to avoid penalties. Late payment incurs 5% surcharge plus interest.

### Should I use a currency broker?
For transfers over €50,000, currency brokers typically save 2-4% versus banks. They offer better rates, lower fees, and risk management tools like forward contracts.

### What happens if I need to sell quickly?
Quick sales often require 10-15% price reductions. Budget for capital gains tax: 19-23% for non-residents. The entire process takes 2-4 months minimum.
