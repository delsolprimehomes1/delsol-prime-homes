    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-foreground">Buying abroad: clarity beats risk</h2>
    <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">For UK and Irish buyers, Spain''s sunny lifestyle is magnetic—but the legal framework is different from home. Contracts are typically drafted in Spanish, licensing varies by municipality, and hidden liabilities can sit on a property (community debts, unpaid taxes, builder issues). A <strong>bilingual property lawyer</strong> is your shield: they translate the process into plain English, test every assumption, and stop small oversights from becoming costly mistakes.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 text-foreground">What your lawyer actually does</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground mb-4">
      <li><strong>Ownership & debt checks:</strong> Pulls a <em>Nota Simple</em> from the Land Registry to confirm the seller''s title and flag encumbrances (mortgages, liens, embargoes).</li>
      <li><strong>Licences & legality:</strong> Confirms <strong>building permits</strong>, <strong>first/second occupancy licences</strong>, planning status, and that square metres match reality.</li>
      <li><strong>Contract fairness:</strong> Negotiates <strong>reservation</strong> and <strong>private purchase</strong> terms (timelines, penalties, snagging), ensuring your obligations are realistic.</li>
      <li><strong>Financial compliance:</strong> Oversees payments, ensures anti-money-laundering rules are met, and prepares the <strong>tax/fee</strong> schedule.</li>
      <li><strong>Completion & registration:</strong> Coordinates the <strong>notary</strong> appointment, executes deed signing, and <strong>registers</strong> your ownership.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="mb-6">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-foreground">Why this matters for lifestyle and investment</h2>
    <p class="text-muted-foreground">Legal diligence isn''t just bureaucracy—it protects <strong>resale value</strong>, <strong>rental potential</strong>, and your ability to enjoy the home without surprises. A clear paper trail boosts buyer confidence later and avoids admin headaches that can stall sales or holiday rentals.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-foreground">From contract to keys: what happens at the end</h2>
    <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4">Completion in Spain culminates at the <strong>notary</strong>. The notary validates identities, confirms the deed language, and witnesses the final transfer of funds. But it''s your <strong>lawyer</strong> who orchestrates the entire finale—lining up bank certificates, ensuring the seller clears any mortgage, and confirming community and utility balances.</p>

      <li><strong>Taxes & fees:</strong> Your lawyer pays ITP/IVA, notary, registry, and legal fees from the funds allocated.</li>
      <li><strong>Registration:</strong> Deed is submitted to the <strong>Land Registry</strong>; once inscribed, you''re recorded as the legal owner.</li>

    <p class="text-muted-foreground">Without inscription at the Land Registry, third parties can''t reliably see your ownership. Registration protects your title, simplifies future financing or resale, and prevents unwelcome surprises years later.</p>
