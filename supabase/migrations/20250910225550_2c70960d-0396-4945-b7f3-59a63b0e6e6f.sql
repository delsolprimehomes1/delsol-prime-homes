  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4 mt-8">A lifestyle powered by sunshine and variety</h2>
  <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">The Costa del Sol isn''t just another Mediterranean destination—it''s a <strong>year-round hub for activity</strong>. Its enviable climate (over 320 sunny days annually) and unique geography make it possible to enjoy world-class golf, padel, tennis, walking, and cycling almost every day of the year.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3 mt-6">Golf paradise</h3>
  <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">With more than <strong>70 golf courses</strong> stretching from Málaga to Sotogrande, the Costa del Sol is rightfully called the "Costa del Golf." Championship venues like <strong>Valderrama</strong> and resort clubs like <strong>La Cala</strong> combine prestige with accessibility, letting players of all levels find their perfect course. For homeowners, proximity to golf courses adds not only lifestyle value but also consistent rental appeal for sport-driven guests.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3 mt-6">Padel & tennis dominance</h3>
  <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">Spain is the birthplace of modern <strong>padel</strong>, and the Costa del Sol is its most international stage. Clubs like <strong>Puente Romano Tennis & Padel</strong> and <strong>Higuerón Sports Club</strong> offer social ladders, clinics, and English-speaking coaches. Expats quickly find padel or tennis clubs become their <strong>social anchor</strong>, blending fitness with friendship.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3 mt-6">Walking, cycling & outdoor flow</h3>
  <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">The <strong>Senda Litoral</strong> (coastal path) and inland trails near <strong>Mijas</strong> and <strong>Benahavís</strong> open up scenic routes for walkers and cyclists alike. Flat promenades suit family strolls, while mountain backdrops challenge cycling enthusiasts. This variety fuels both <strong>daily routines</strong> and <strong>destination tourism appeal</strong>.</p>

  <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-3 mt-6">Wellness & recovery culture</h3>
  <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-4 leading-relaxed">Beyond sport, the Costa del Sol layers in <strong>five-star spas</strong>, medical wellness clinics, and boutique studios. From yoga to CrossFit, residents enjoy a lifestyle that blends Mediterranean leisure with modern fitness science—perfect for longevity, energy, and stress relief.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4 mt-8">Why it matters for buyers</h2>
  <p class="text-muted-foreground mb-6 leading-relaxed">A climate-proof, wellness-driven lifestyle supports <strong>quality of life</strong> and boosts <strong>investment potential</strong>. Homes near sport and wellness amenities consistently command higher resale interest and attract long-stay renters from health-minded Northern European markets.</p>
