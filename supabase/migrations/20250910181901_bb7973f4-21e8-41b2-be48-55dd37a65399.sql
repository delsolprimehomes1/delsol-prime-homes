    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Inland Options: Mijas, Ojén, and Mountain Villages</h3>

    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">The Costa del Sol property market continues to demonstrate remarkable resilience and growth, driven by international demand, lifestyle migration trends, and Spain''s competitive position within the European property market. Understanding current market dynamics, price trends, and future projections is essential for making informed investment decisions in this dynamic market.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Current Market Performance Indicators</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">The Costa del Sol market has experienced consistent growth over the past five years, with average price increases of 8-12% annually across most segments. This growth is supported by limited supply of quality properties, increasing international demand, and the region''s growing reputation as a premium European destination for both residents and investors.</p>

      <li class="ml-4"><strong>Price growth:</strong> 8-12% annual increases across most market segments</li>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">International Buyer Demographics and Preferences</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">British and Irish buyers continue to represent the largest segment of international purchasers, comprising approximately 35% of foreign transactions. German, Scandinavian, and French buyers follow, with emerging interest from American and Canadian investors. Brexit has had minimal impact on purchase decisions, with many buyers viewing Spanish property as a hedge against UK economic uncertainty.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Luxury Segment Performance</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">The luxury market (properties above €1.5 million) shows particularly strong performance, with Marbella''s Golden Mile, Puerto Banús, and Nueva Andalucía leading price appreciation. Ultra-high-net-worth buyers are increasingly seeking modern amenities, privacy, and sustainable features, driving demand for contemporary villas and penthouses with advanced home technology.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Mid-Market Opportunities and Growth Areas</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">The mid-market segment (€300,000-€800,000) offers excellent opportunities for both investors and lifestyle buyers. Estepona, Fuengirola, and emerging areas like La Cala de Mijas show strong growth potential with new developments, improved infrastructure, and growing international communities. These areas offer better value compared to established luxury locations while providing similar lifestyle benefits.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Rental Market and Investment Yields</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">The rental market remains robust with strong demand from both long-term residents and short-term vacation rentals. Properties in prime beachfront locations or golf communities achieve the highest rental yields, typically 5-8% annually. The growing popularity of remote work has increased demand for long-term rentals, particularly properties with home office space and reliable internet connectivity.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Infrastructure Development Impact</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Ongoing infrastructure improvements continue to enhance Costa del Sol''s attractiveness. The expansion of Málaga airport, improvements to the A-7 motorway, and new train connections improve accessibility and reduce travel times. These infrastructure investments typically result in 5-10% property value increases in affected areas within 2-3 years of completion.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Future Market Projections</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Market analysts project continued growth of 6-10% annually over the next 3-5 years, driven by sustained international demand, limited supply of quality properties, and Spain''s competitive position within Europe. Climate change concerns may increase migration to Mediterranean climates, while digital nomad trends support sustained rental demand.</p>

    <p class="text-lg font-medium text-foreground">Buying property in Spain involves reserva contracts, NIE numbers, notary appointments, and property registration. Legal oversight ensures compliance with Spanish property law throughout the process.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="detailed-content">
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-6 mt-10 text-foreground">Step-by-Step Spanish Property Purchase Process</h2>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">The Spanish property buying process follows a structured legal framework designed to protect both buyers and sellers. Understanding each stage, required documentation, and potential challenges helps ensure a smooth transaction while avoiding common pitfalls that can delay or complicate your property purchase.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Stage 1: Property Search and Selection</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Begin with thorough research of areas, property types, and market prices. Obtain your NIE (Número de Identificación de Extranjero) as early as possible, as this tax identification number is required for all property transactions. Consider engaging a qualified Spanish lawyer before making any offers to ensure proper legal representation throughout the process.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Stage 2: Making an Offer and Reserva Contract</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Once you identify a suitable property, make a formal offer through the estate agent. If accepted, you''ll typically sign a reserva (reservation) contract and pay a small deposit (usually €3,000-€6,000) to take the property off the market. This provides 14-21 days to complete due diligence and arrange financing before signing the main purchase contract.</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
      <li class="ml-4">Reservation deposit: €3,000-€6,000 (refundable under certain conditions)</li>
      <li class="ml-4">Reservation period: 14-21 days for due diligence</li>
      <li class="ml-4">Legal review: Essential before signing any binding agreements</li>
      <li class="ml-4">Property valuation: Required for mortgage applications</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Stage 3: Due Diligence and Legal Checks</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Your lawyer conducts comprehensive due diligence including property title verification, outstanding debt checks, urban planning compliance verification, and community fee status. This stage also includes obtaining building certificates, energy efficiency certificates, and ensuring all required permits are current and valid.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Stage 4: Private Purchase Contract (Contrato de Arras)</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">After successful due diligence, both parties sign the private purchase contract. This legally binding agreement includes purchase price, completion date, penalty clauses, and specific conditions. Buyers typically pay 10% of the purchase price as a deposit at this stage. The contract protects both parties and establishes the framework for completion.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Stage 5: Mortgage Application and Approval</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">If financing is required, submit your complete mortgage application including all required documentation. Spanish banks typically take 4-6 weeks to process applications for non-residents. Ensure your lawyer reviews all mortgage terms and conditions, including early repayment clauses and insurance requirements.</p>

    <div class="bg-muted/30 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6">
      <h4 class="font-semibold mb-2 text-foreground">Essential Legal Documents Required:</h4>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        <li class="ml-4">NIE number (tax identification for foreigners)</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Passport and residency documentation</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Property title deeds (escritura)</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Urban planning certificate (cédula de habitabilidad)</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Energy efficiency certificate</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Community fees certificate</li>
        <li class="ml-4">IBI tax receipts (property tax)</li>
        <li class="ml-4">Building insurance policy</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Stage 6: Final Completion and Notary Appointment</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">The final completion takes place at the notary''s office where the public deed (escritura pública) is signed in the presence of all parties. The remaining purchase price is transferred, keys are handed over, and ownership is officially transferred. The notary ensures all legal requirements are met and the transaction is properly documented.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Stage 7: Post-Completion Registration</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">After completion, your lawyer registers the property in your name at the Property Registry (Registro de la Propiedad). This provides official proof of ownership and protects your property rights. Additional post-completion tasks include arranging utilities transfers, property insurance, and setting up community fee payments.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 mt-8 text-foreground">Common Challenges and How to Avoid Them</h3>
    
    <p class="mb-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">Typical challenges include documentation delays, currency fluctuation risks, and communication issues between parties. Working with experienced professionals who understand both Spanish law and international client needs significantly reduces these risks. Proper planning and early legal engagement prevent most common problems.</p>
