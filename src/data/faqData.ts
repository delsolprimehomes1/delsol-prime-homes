Energy features like aerothermal systems and solar can cut energy costs by up to ~40%. Staged payments typically mean 20–30% during construction and ~60% on completion, improving cash flow. Amenities and smart-home features drive higher rental and resale demand (often 15–20% higher than older stock). Lifestyle benefits—Málaga flight connectivity, 300+ days of sun, golf, healthcare—add long-term appeal. DelSolPrimeHomes provides VIP tours and multilingual guidance from reservation to key handover, with clear tax treatment (10% VAT on new builds vs ~7% ITP on resales).",

    details: "(1) Selection & Reservation: choose a project with DelSolPrimeHomes; typical refundable reservation €6,000–€10,000 pending legal checks. (2) Legal due diligence: an independent lawyer verifies permits, contracts, floorplans, and developer track record. (3) Private Purchase Contract: pay ~20–30% in one to three instalments. (4) Construction phase: receive progress updates, photos, and potential upgrade options. (5) Notarial signing: pay the remaining ~60%, sign the public deed, and receive keys; DelSolPrimeHomes can support NIE, bank account, and sworn translation. (6) After-sales: title registration, utilities setup, furniture, rentals, and ongoing support.",
    category: "Buying Process"
  },
  {
    question: "What legal guarantees apply when buying new-build property in Spain?",
    answer: "Deposits are protected by a legally required bank guarantee or insurance; new builds include a 10-year structural warranty (plus shorter guarantees for finishes). Notarial oversight and permit verification ensure transparency.",
    details: "(1) Bank guarantee/insurance on all advance payments until delivery; refundable if the project is not delivered or cancelled. (2) 10-year structural warranty (foundation, roof, stability); typical 1–3 years for functional elements (plumbing, windows, finishes). (3) Permit verification: your lawyer confirms building license and First Occupancy Certificate before handover. (4) Public deed before a Spanish notary confirms legality and obligations; the property is then registered in your name.",
    category: "Legal"
  },
  {
    question: "What is a bank guarantee when buying new-build property in Spain?",
    answer: "A bank guarantee (or insurance bond) legally protects your instalment payments (typically 20–30% during construction). If the developer fails to deliver or legalize the project, you can recover 100% of your funds.",
    details: "Spain's Law 38/1999 (LOE) requires developers to secure buyers' payments with a bank guarantee or insurance until delivery. The document lists your name, the amount paid, the reserved unit, and the refund clause. Your independent lawyer—coordinated by DelSolPrimeHomes—verifies it before you sign and before the first instalment after reservation. If triggered (e.g., cancellation or non-compliance), refunds are typically processed within ~30–90 days by the issuing bank/insurer.",
    category: "Legal"
  },
  {
    question: "Is it possible to view a new-build project before it is fully completed?",
    answer: "Yes. You can usually tour show homes or completed phases, arrange guided site visits during construction, and access virtual tours before final delivery.",
    details: "Developers often prepare a furnished show apartment or model villa to preview layouts and finishes. Guided site visits (with safety gear) are coordinated by DelSolPrimeHomes and the developer. In later phases, finished units may be viewable by appointment. Many projects offer 360º virtual tours or 3D walkthroughs. Serious buyers can opt for a VIP viewing experience (private transport, hotel, multilingual guidance) to compare several developments efficiently.",
    category: "Viewing & Offers"
  },
  {
    question: "What is the average construction time for a new-build villa or apartment in the Málaga region?",
    answer: "Most Costa del Sol projects complete ~16–24 months after the building license is granted—apartments often 16–20 months; bespoke villas ~18–24 months.",
    details: "Timings vary by property type, scale, and permitting. The clock starts only after the official building license (Licencia de Obra). Buying at pre-launch can secure better prices and unit choice, with delivery typically in 18–24 months. DelSolPrimeHomes provides transparent planning, photo updates, and safeguards. Some standardized or turnkey concepts can deliver in ~12–15 months.",
    category: "New-build vs Resale"
  },
  {
    question: "How do stage payments work for new-build property purchases in Spain?",
    answer: "Stage payments spread the cost—typically 20–30% during construction, with the remaining 60% at completion, protected by a bank guarantee.",
    details: "After a small reservation deposit (€6k–€10k), buyers sign a private contract and pay 20–30% in instalments as construction progresses. Each instalment is backed by a bank guarantee, ensuring funds are recoverable if the developer defaults. The final balance (~60%) is paid at notarial signing. This structure improves cash flow, reduces upfront capital commitment, and aligns with construction milestones.",
    category: "Financing"
  },
  {
    question: "What additional costs should buyers expect when purchasing a new-build property?",
    answer: "Beyond the purchase price, budget ~12–14% for VAT, legal fees, notary, registry, and other closing costs.",
    details: "Costs include 10% VAT (IVA) on new builds, 1.5% stamp duty (AJD in Andalucía), legal fees (~1%), notary and registry (~0.5–1%), and bank/translation fees if needed. Buyers should allow an extra ~12–14% of the purchase price in total. DelSolPrimeHomes provides tailored cost estimates before commitment.",
    category: "Fees & Costs"
  },
  {
    question: "Are mortgages available to non-residents for new-build properties in Spain?",
    answer: "Yes. Non-residents can usually borrow up to 60–70% of the property value with terms of 20–30 years.",
    details: "Spanish and international banks offer mortgages to non-residents, subject to income verification, creditworthiness, and property valuation. Loan-to-value ratios average 60–70%, interest rates are competitive (fixed or variable), and terms can reach 25–30 years. Buyers need a NIE number and Spanish bank account. DelSolPrimeHomes works with mortgage brokers to secure approvals in advance.",
    category: "Mortgages"
  },
  {
    question: "What taxes apply to buying a new-build versus a resale property?",
    answer: "New builds incur 10% VAT + 1.5% stamp duty; resales pay a 7% transfer tax in Andalucía.",
    details: "On new builds, buyers pay 10% VAT (IVA) and 1.5% AJD stamp duty. On resales, buyers pay a transfer tax (ITP), currently 7% in Andalucía, with no VAT. Both incur notary, registry, and legal fees. Tax implications can influence investment strategies and cash flow.",
    category: "Taxes"
  },
  {
    question: "What is the Certificate of First Occupation (Licencia de Primera Ocupación)?",
    answer: "It's the town hall permit certifying a property is completed legally and fit for occupation—essential for utility hookups and rentals.",
    details: "Issued after municipal inspection, it confirms compliance with the building license and regulations. No property should be occupied or connected to mains utilities without it. Your lawyer verifies its issuance before completion. DelSolPrimeHomes only markets projects guaranteed to receive this certificate.",
    category: "Legal"
  },
  {
    question: "How do developers handle snagging and quality checks?",
    answer: "Buyers get a snagging period (typically 30 days) to report defects; developers must remedy them under warranty.",
    details: "After delivery, DelSolPrimeHomes assists buyers in inspecting finishes, installations, and fittings. Defects are listed in a snagging report. Developers are contractually obliged to fix them within agreed timelines. The structural warranty (10 years) and shorter-term guarantees (1–3 years) cover hidden defects and functionality issues.",
    category: "Due Diligence"
  },
  {
    question: "What rental yields are achievable with new-build Costa del Sol properties?",
    answer: "Short-term holiday rentals average 5–8% yields; long-term lets 3–5%, depending on location and amenities.",
    details: "Marbella, Estepona, and Málaga city achieve premium yields due to tourism and expat demand. Smart-home features, pools, gyms, and proximity to golf or beaches boost occupancy. Holiday rentals can outperform resales due to modern appeal. DelSolPrimeHomes can connect buyers with rental management firms to maximize ROI.",
    category: "Market Trends"
  },
  {
    question: "Can buyers resell their new-build property before completion?",
    answer: "Yes—called contract assignment—but it depends on the developer's terms.",
    details: "Some developers permit resale of the private purchase contract before completion, subject to fees or approvals. This can allow investors to profit from market appreciation before full delivery. Legal advice is crucial, and DelSolPrimeHomes ensures buyers know the resale conditions upfront.",

    details: "Services include curated property tours, legal introductions, mortgage assistance, construction updates, notarial completion, utility setup, snagging, rentals, and resale strategy. The team provides multilingual support, VIP viewings, and exclusive listings—ensuring a smooth, transparent experience.",
    category: "General"
  },
  {
    question: "What is the difference between off-plan and key-ready properties?",
